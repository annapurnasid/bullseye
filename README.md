## How does the app work?
A random number is generated
The player moves the slider to achieve the random number as close to as possible
When hit me is pressed, an alert appears which shows the slider value

The app is designed for the **landscape** orientation. The app looks like this:

This is the main game page.

This is the alert result dialog that appears on hitting the 'HIT ME' button.
